lamda-js
========
lamda.js is lightweight Javascript framework for manipulating (filter, map, forEach, groupBy) lists/arrays using lamda syntax.
The framework provides a fluent API for manipulating arrays. The API currently resembles guava FluentIterable.
The API will be updated to introduce more groovy like functionalities.
